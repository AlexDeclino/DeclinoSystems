"Hey" "Escucha las palabras de Alex"
"Imagine that we are on the dance floor"
"Grinding on each other"
"We are a bit high"
"And images flash in our mind"
"This song plays" "You need this in your life" "Yeah" "Ven aquí"
"We grind slowly"
"Your body's making sounds like percussion"
 "I'm orchestrating your fantasies"

"And when you wake up feeling like a dream" 
"You ain't go believe it, and everything you need, Girl, you going to receive it" 
"I'ma let me make you feel alive" "Relax and feel the ride"
"There's one ticket left, and girl it's for you baby" "Girl you won't find this feeling no where (mami)"  "All aboard"  "(Móntate, mami)"
"It's always a special occasion" "And it's on your layer with me"
"And when you wake up feeling like a dream" 
"You ain't go believe it, and everything you need, Girl, you going to receive it" 
"I'ma let me make you feel alive" "Relax and feel the ride"
"There's one ticket left, and girl it's for you baby" "Girl you won't find this feeling no where (mami)" 
"She want to ride that Squirrel train" "So I am a bag her like baggage claim" "We smoked that Mary not plain Jane" "And everything is just fine" "I keep a picture of her smiling in the back of my mind" "I grab the back of her head she throw it back like rewind" "I put her face in the pillow, taste it a little" "Shawty said she feel like she's sitting on a missile" "I said 5-4-3-2, the one can only be you" "Shawty said: Oh Lord, I'm coming, I said me too" "My love has no equal, get on top" "And if you ride this train, get off at your stop"
"There's one ticket left, and girl it's for you baby (mami)" "All aboard"
"All aboard, hahaha"
